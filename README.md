# MoPiX 2 - Programming Using Algebra

An educational visual programming platform that enables students to create animations and interactive models using algebraic equations.

## 🌐 Live Demo

**Try the modern web version:** [https://toontalk.github.io/mopix2/](https://toontalk.github.io/mopix2/)

A proof-of-concept reimplementation using modern web technologies (vanilla JavaScript, no dependencies, 23KB single file). Features 4 animated objects demonstrating expression evaluation, canvas rendering, and frame-accurate animation.

See [docs/](docs/) for the standalone HTML demo and [mopix-modern-poc/](mopix-modern-poc/) for the full TypeScript/React implementation.

## Overview

MoPiX 2 allows users to:
- Create visual objects with algebraic equations defining their properties (position, size, color, rotation, etc.)
- Build temporal/time-based animations with frame-by-frame control
- Edit mathematical expressions using an interactive equation editor
- Save and load models
- Support for multiple languages (English, Greek, Portuguese)

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Google Web Toolkit (GWT) 1.7.0
- **Backend**: Java with Google App Engine
- **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas
- **Math**: MathML for mathematical expression rendering
- **Persistence**: DataNucleus JPA with JDO

## Project Status

This is a legacy educational project originally developed for Google Code and migrated to Git. The codebase uses technologies from 2010 and requires modernization for current production use.

## Getting Started

**Note**: This project requires Eclipse IDE with GWT and Google App Engine plugins installed.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mopix2
   ```

2. Import into Eclipse as existing project

3. Ensure GWT SDK and App Engine SDK are configured

4. Run using Eclipse launch configurations

## Modernization Needed

This project uses significantly outdated technologies and would benefit from:
- Testing infrastructure (currently has zero tests)
- Modern build system (Maven/Gradle)
- Updated dependencies (security vulnerabilities likely)
- Framework migration (GWT 1.7.0 is from 2010)
- Documentation improvements
- CI/CD pipeline

See [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md) for detailed recommendations.
